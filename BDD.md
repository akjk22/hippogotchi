# A place to brainstorm BDD specs

1. The absolute easiest thing to start with would be:
  * a single function
  * for a single button
  * a single stat, that is affected by the function and the button

2. The next easiest is to have two functions/buttons: one that makes the stat go up, and one that makes the stat go down.  

* We could start with like a "Happiness stat," that goes up when you hit the "play with" button, and goes down if you hit the "ignore" button.

Y/N? Other ideas?
